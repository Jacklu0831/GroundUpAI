# GroundUpAI
A deep learning library that is entirely implemented from scratch (even backpropagation) without depending on external libraries/frameworks (except for torch.Tensor due to the subpar FLOPS of plain python), hence the name "ground up". 

GroundUpAI aims to make model training more customizable than ever and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code for deep learning. You can look at this [this demo](https://jacklu.tech/GroundUpAI/Demo.html) for some proof. In addition, it also has built-in advanced model architectures (e.g. [ResNet](https://jacklu.tech/GroundUpAI/AdvancedArchitectures.html)).
